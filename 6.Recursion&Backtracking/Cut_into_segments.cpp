A rod is given of length N and length x,y,z are given the rod can be cut into the lengths of x,y,z and the rod has to be cut in such a way that it has maximum segments using x,y,z
Example:N=7
  x=5,y=2,z=2
  output=>2
  Explanation:5,2
  2)N=8
  x=3,y=3,z=3
  output=>0
  3)N=3
  x=1,y=2,z=3
  output=>3
