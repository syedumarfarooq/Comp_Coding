// A int array is given which contains number by using that number you have to find the targer by adding and give the minimum elements required to reach targer
// eg:target:3 arr=[1,2]
//   output=>2
// Explaination:1+1+1=3 [1,1,1] 3 elements required to reach the target
//              1+2=3   [1,2]   2 elements required to reach the target
//              2+1=3   [2,1]  2 elements required to reach the target
//             so the minimum elements required is two
