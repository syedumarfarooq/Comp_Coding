// Class I
// CHAR ARRAY
  char name[100];
  cin>>name;
  cin>>name[2];//this takes input of single character
// NOTE:by default at the end of char array an null character is placed "\O" is discribes string termination
  #include <string.h>
  cin.getline(name,50);//it is used to get input of char where there are spaces included for example :name is umar syed it will take in just umar
  // but if you use getline it takes input as umar syed
