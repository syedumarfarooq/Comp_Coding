// 1)OPTIMIZING SIEVE OF ERATOSHENES(imp theorem for counting prime)
-make a array from 2 to n-1 which represent all number and mark them as true(prime no)
-start from 2 till end mark all the multiples of 2 except 2 as non prime i.e false
-repeat till end where it is true and mark its multiples false
-count the number of prime numbers i.e true
